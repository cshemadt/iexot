# Welcome to Iexot ðŸ‘‹

" Tiny terminal text editor inspired by Vim and Emacs. Written just for learning purposes, but there are many ideas to realize.

## Features:
Navigating in vimacs way: "Ctrl-h", "Ctrl-j", "Ctrl-k", "Ctrl-l";
Jumping to the beginning and end of the line: "Ctrl-a", "Ctrl-e";
    Navigating to the beggining, mid and end of the file: "Ctrl-g s", "Ctrl-g m", "Ctrl-g e";
    Jumping to the first letter of the word/symbol/numbers in vim way: "Ctrl-w" and "Ctrl-b";
    Searching in the file with highlighted matched words. To enter "search mode" press "Ctrl-f" and start type. Without leaving "search mode" you can navigate selected words with following keys: "Ctrl-n n" (next occurence), "Ctrl-n p" (previous);
    Highlighing keywords, numbers, commented lines, strings depend on opened file extension
